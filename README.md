# Movie-Search-App

A simple IMDB movie details search app made from NodeJS & Express with ejs as the template language. It accesses the 
TMDB(The Movie Database - https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) API endpoints to access IMDB database and show the results.

It uses request module(https://www.npmjs.com/package/request), to make HTTP requests to TMDB database.

Made as part of learning AJAX requests and accessing APIs.
